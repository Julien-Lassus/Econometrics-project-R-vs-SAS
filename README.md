# Econometrics-project-R-vs-SAS
This project is an econometric study on Premier League football players from the 2021 season: What is the impact of market values and on-field performances on their salaries? The main goal was to improve my skills in R and SAS, as I had to use both languages for this analysis. It was very useful in understanding their differences and strengths.
